# Retail-sales-prediction
Introduction
Retail Sales Forecast employs advanced machine learning techniques, prioritizing careful data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and comprehensive algorithm assessment and selection. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends, patterns, and data insights. It offers users interactive tools to explore top-performing stores and departments, conduct insightful feature comparisons, and obtain personalized sales forecasts. With a commitment to delivering actionable insights, the project aims to optimize decision-making processes within the dynamic retail landscape.

# Key Technologies and Skills:

  Python,

  Scikit-Learn,

  Numpy,

  Pandas,

  Plotly,

  Matplotlib,

  Seaborn.

# 1.) Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

  Load the datasets.
  
  Handle missing values.
  
  Convert date formats.
  
  Extract features such as year, month, and week number.
  
  Normalize or scale numerical data.

# 2.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  Visualize trends, seasonality, and the impact of holidays.
  
  Analyze correlations between sales and other features.

# 3.) Feature Engineering:

  Create new features such as lagged sales, rolling averages, and holiday flags.
  
  Encode categorical variables as needed.

# 4.) Model Selection and Training:

  Split data into training and validation sets.

  Train various models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest, LSTM).

  Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE and MAE, with a focus on holiday weeks.

# 5.) Markdown Effect Analysis:

  Simulate sales with and without markdowns.
  
  Quantify the impact of markdowns on sales.

# 6.) Recommendations:

  Provide actionable insights for markdown strategies and holiday planning.
  
  Suggest improvements for future data collection.

# 7.) Results:

  Sales Forecasts: Accurate weekly sales predictions for each department.

  Markdown Insights: Quantitative analysis of markdown impacts on sales.

  Strategic Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions for promotional and holiday strategies to maximize business impact.

# 8.) Project Evaluation Metrics:

  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  
  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  
  Weighted Metrics: Higher weights for holiday weeks to reflect their importance.

# 9.) Project Deliverables:

Source Code: Well-documented codebase with comments and explanations.



# Some recommendations based on sales data analysis:

# 1.) Markdown Strategies:

Optimize Timing: The markdown strategy should be optimized based on the model's predictions to maximize sales while minimizing loss. High RMSE and MAE values in markdown predictions suggest a need for better timing and selection of products for markdown.

Selective Markdown Application: Consider applying markdowns selectively to items with lower elasticity. Products that do not show significant sales improvement after markdowns might be better off with other promotional strategies.

 
# 2.) Holiday Planning:

Early Inventory Adjustments: Predictions can inform inventory adjustments before major holidays. Stocking up on high-demand items well before holidays can help capture early shoppers and avoid stockouts.

Tailored Promotions: Use model predictions to create holiday-specific promotions. For instance, markdowns might be more effective on specific product categories during holidays, and these should be targeted with appropriate marketing.

# 3.)  Data Collection Improvements:

Granular Markdown Data: Collect more detailed data on markdown application, including exact times and duration of markdowns, as well as the percentage markdown. This will improve the accuracy of markdown predictions.

Enhanced Feature Set: Include additional features like customer demographics, competitor pricing, and external economic indicators (e.g., consumer confidence index) to enrich the data and improve model accuracy.

Holiday-Specific Indicators: Integrate holiday-specific variables such as special promotions, advertising spend, or holiday-themed product lines to refine holiday planning predictions.
