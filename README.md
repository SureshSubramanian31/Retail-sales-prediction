# Retail-sales-prediction
Introduction
Retail Sales Forecast employs advanced machine learning techniques, prioritizing careful data preprocessing, feature enhancement, and comprehensive algorithm assessment and selection. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find trends, patterns, and data insights. It offers users interactive tools to explore top-performing stores and departments, conduct insightful feature comparisons, and obtain personalized sales forecasts. With a commitment to delivering actionable insights, the project aims to optimize decision-making processes within the dynamic retail landscape.

# Key Technologies and Skills:

# 1.) Data Understanding and Preprocessing:

  Load the datasets.
  
  Handle missing values.
  
  Convert date formats.
  
  Extract features such as year, month, and week number.
  
  Normalize or scale numerical data.

# 2.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  Visualize trends, seasonality, and the impact of holidays.
  
  Analyze correlations between sales and other features.

# 3.) Feature Engineering:

  Create new features such as lagged sales, rolling averages, and holiday flags.
  
  Encode categorical variables as needed.

# 4.) Model Selection and Training:

  Split data into training and validation sets.

  Train various models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest, LSTM).

  Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE and MAE, with a focus on holiday weeks.

# 5.) Markdown Effect Analysis:

  Simulate sales with and without markdowns.
  
  Quantify the impact of markdowns on sales.

# 6.) Recommendations:

  Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  
  Weighted Metrics: Higher weights for holiday weeks to reflect their importance.

# 9.) Project Deliverables:

Source Code: Well-documented codebase with comments and explanations.



# Some recommendations based on sales data analysis:

# 1.) Seasonality Analysis:

  Examine sales data to identify seasonal patterns. Increase inventory and marketing efforts during peak seasons.

# 2.) Product Performance:

  Identify high-performing and low-performing products. Focus on promoting and stocking high-demand items while discontinuing or discounting low-performing ones.

# 3.) Customer Segmentation:

  Segment customers based on purchasing behavior. Tailor marketing strategies to different segments to increase sales.

# 4.) Promotion Effectiveness:

  Analyze the impact of promotions and markdowns on sales. Optimize promotional strategies to maximize revenue.

# 5.) Inventory Management:

  Ensure optimal inventory levels to avoid stockouts and overstock situations. Use sales forecasts to guide inventory decisions.

#6.) Pricing Strategy:

  Evaluate pricing strategies to find the optimal price point that maximizes sales and profitability.

# 7.) Store Layout and Placement:

  Analyze the store layout and product placement to enhance customer experience and drive sales.
